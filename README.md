- The "Lost Customer" group has the highest proportion (4,621 customers) → The company should implement a strategy to re-engage this group, such as email marketing or special promotions.
  
- The "Big Spenders" group has the fewest customers (937 customers), but they generate high order value. The company can focus on retaining this group through a Loyalty Program.

- The "Loyal" group (3,546 customers) is crucial, and the company should consider offering rewards programs to maintain their loyalty.

- The "Potential Churn" group (3,684 customers) requires special attention, as these customers are at risk of leaving. Marketing and customer care strategies should be implemented to retain them.

- The "Promising" group (2,853 customers) has potential and could be targeted with upsell or cross-sell strategies to turn them into loyal customers.
